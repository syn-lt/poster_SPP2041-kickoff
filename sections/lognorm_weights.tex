\section*{\LARGE Log-normal distributions of synaptic weights in noise driven networks}

In cortical circuits the distribution of synaptic weights approximately follows a log-normal distribution in which very few strong weights are embedded in a sea of small weights. A number of computational models address the . Typically the result . Here we are following a hypothesis that not much is needed.


\section*{Network model}

The network is thus completely noise driven and devoid of correlations.
